SQL Server Hands-On Exercises

Weâ€™ll use the same employees table from before. If you havenâ€™t already created it, here's the setup:
ðŸ›  Step 1: Table Setup

CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(30),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    hire_date DATE,
    manager_id INT
);

INSERT INTO employees VALUES (101, 'Alice', 'HR', 50000, '2019-03-15', NULL);
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (102, 'Bob', 'Finance', 60000, '2020-06-01', 101);
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (103, 'Charlie', 'IT', 70000, '2021-01-12', 101);
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (104, 'Diana', 'IT', 72000, '2022-05-30', 103);
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (105, 'Evan', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);


### SECTION 1: SELECT + WHERE ###
1. View all employees:

SELECT * FROM employees;

2. View employees in IT department:

SELECT emp_name, department
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'IT';

### SECTION 2: ARITHMETIC OPERATORS '+' ###

3.Generate a display string like: using '+'
Alice (HR) earns $50000 and joined in March 2019

SELECT emp_name + ' (' + ISNULL(department, 'No Dept') + ') earns $' +
       CAST(salary AS VARCHAR) + ' and joined in ' +
       FORMAT(hire_date, 'MMMM yyyy') AS employee_summary
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date IS NOT NULL AND salary IS NOT NULL;

4.Calculate Salary After Annual Deduction

Use subtraction (-) to simulate tax or PF deduction.

SELECT emp_name,
       salary,
       salary - 5000 AS net_salary_after_deduction
FROM employees
WHERE salary IS NOT NULL;

5.Calculate Salary Distribution: % Increments

Use division (/) and multiplication (*) to get percent increase over a base.

SELECT emp_name,
       salary,
       (salary / 50000.0) * 100 AS percentage_of_base
FROM employees
WHERE salary IS NOT NULL;

6. Show employees whose salary is not a multiple of 1000

Use modulo (%) to find remainders.

SELECT emp_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary % 1000 <> 0;

### SECTION 3 COMPARISON OPERATORS ###

7. Show employees in IT department:

SELECT emp_name, department
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'IT';

7b. Top Earners by Department

Task: For each department, show the name of the employee(s) who earns the highest salary.

SELECT e.emp_name, e.salary, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE e.salary = (
    SELECT MAX(salary)
    FROM employees
    WHERE dept_id = e.dept_id
);

8. Employees Earning Above Company Average

Task: List employees whose salary is above the company-wide average.

SELECT emp_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE salary IS NOT NULL
);

9. Show employees whose salary is not a multiple of 1000

Use modulo (%) to find remainders.

SELECT emp_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary % 1000 <> 0;

10. Departments With Below-Average Salary Cost

Task: Show departments where the total salary payout is below the average salary payout across all departments.

SELECT d.dept_name, SUM(e.salary) AS dept_total_salary
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
GROUP BY d.dept_name
HAVING SUM(e.salary) < (
    SELECT AVG(total)
    FROM (
        SELECT SUM(salary) AS total
        FROM employees
        WHERE salary IS NOT NULL
        GROUP BY dept_id
    ) AS dept_sums
);

11. Department-wise Employee Count & Salary Cost

Task: Show the total number of employees and total salary per department. Include only departments with at least 2 employees.

SELECT d.dept_name,
       COUNT(e.emp_id) AS total_employees,
       SUM(e.salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
GROUP BY d.dept_name
HAVING COUNT(e.emp_id) >= 2;

### SECTION 4 LOGICAL OPERATORS ###

Operator	Description
AND	All conditions must be true
OR	At least one condition must be true
NOT	Reverses the condition
    
12. Find employees in IT and with salary above 60K

Uses AND to apply both conditions.

SELECT emp_name, department, salary
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'IT' AND salary > 60000;

13. List employees in either HR or Finance department

Uses OR to match one of two departments.

SELECT emp_name, department
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'HR' OR department = 'Finance';

14. Identify employees not assigned to a department

Use NOT with IS NULL (or with IN/LIKE).

SELECT emp_name
FROM employees
WHERE department IS NULL;
-- or
SELECT emp_name
FROM employees
WHERE NOT department IS NOT NULL;
    
15. Employees with salary not between 50K and 70K

Uses NOT with BETWEEN.

SELECT emp_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE NOT (salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 70000);

16. Active employees in IT or HR but salary above 60K

Combines OR and AND with parentheses.

SELECT emp_name, department, salary
FROM employees
WHERE (department = 'IT' OR department = 'HR')
  AND salary > 60000;
  
17. Retired employees not from IT or Finance

Use NOT IN to exclude departments.

SELECT emp_name, department
FROM retired_employees
WHERE department NOT IN ('IT', 'Finance');

18. Employees either missing department or salary

This is useful for data quality checks.

SELECT emp_name
FROM employees
WHERE department IS NULL OR salary IS NULL;

19.Employees in Finance and hired before 2021

    Great for historical team filtering.

SELECT emp_name, hire_date
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Finance' AND hire_date < '2021-01-01';

Use Case				Logical Operator Used
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~		
Filter multiple strict conditions	AND
Match any of multiple values		OR
Exclude specific matches		NOT, NOT IN, NOT LIKE
Data cleansing and audits		OR, IS NULL, NOT NULL


### SECTION 5 SPECIAL OPERATORS ###

20. BETWEEN

Usage: Used to filter values within a specific range (inclusive).
Real-time Example: Employees earning between 55,000 and 70,000

SELECT emp_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary BETWEEN 55000 AND 70000;

21. LIKE

Usage: Used to filter based on a pattern (wildcards: % = multiple chars, _ = one char)
Example 1: Names starting with 'A'

SELECT emp_name
FROM employees
WHERE emp_name LIKE 'A%';

Example 2: Names containing 'an'

SELECT emp_name
FROM employees
WHERE emp_name LIKE '%an%';

22. IN

Usage: Shorthand for multiple OR conditions
Real-time Example: Employees in HR, IT, or Finance

SELECT emp_name, department
FROM employees
WHERE department IN ('HR', 'IT', 'Finance');

23. IS NULL

Usage: Checks if a column has no value
Example 1: Employees missing salary info

SELECT emp_name
FROM employees
WHERE salary IS NULL;

Example 2: Employees missing department

SELECT emp_name
FROM employees
WHERE department IS NULL;

24. EXISTS

Usage: Tests for the existence of rows returned by a subquery.
Example 1: Show departments that have at least one employee

SELECT dept_name
FROM departments d
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM employees e WHERE e.dept_id = d.dept_id
);

Example 2: Show employees who are also in retired_employees table

SELECT emp_name
FROM employees e
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM retired_employees r WHERE r.emp_id = e.emp_id
);


Summary Table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Operator	Purpose					Example
~~~~~~~~~	~~~~~~~~					~~~~~~~~~
BETWEEN		Range filtering				salary BETWEEN 55000 AND 70000
LIKE		Pattern matching			emp_name LIKE 'A%'
IN		Matches multiple values			department IN ('IT', 'HR')
IS NULL		Check for missing values		salary IS NULL
UNIQUE		Enforce uniqueness in columns		Used in CREATE TABLE
EXISTS		Check subquery for row existence	WHERE EXISTS (...)

### SECTION 6 SET OPERATORS ###

25. UNION

UNION: Merge active & retired employee names (no duplicates)

SELECT emp_name FROM employees
UNION
SELECT emp_name FROM retired_employees;

26. UNION ALL

UNION ALL: List all employee names including duplicates

SELECT emp_name FROM employees
UNION ALL
SELECT emp_name FROM retired_employees;

27. INTERSECT: Show employees who exist in both active and retired tables (rehired?)

INTERSECT: Show employees who exist in both active and retired tables (rehired?)

28. MINUS 

EXCEPT: Active employees who have never been retired

SELECT emp_id FROM employees
EXCEPT
SELECT emp_id FROM retired_employees;

EXCEPT: Retired employees who were never in the active table

SELECT emp_id FROM retired_employees
EXCEPT
SELECT emp_id FROM employees;

Use Case					Operator	Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~					~~~~~~~~~	~~~~~~~~~~~~
Merge all current and former employees		UNION		Reporting or messaging
Count employees including repeat hires		UNION ALL	Keep duplicates
Find rehired employees				INTERSECT	In both employees and retired_employees
Get active employees who were never retired	EXCEPT		SQL Serverâ€™s MINUS
Validate data sync across systems		All		Compare user tables across databases

### SECTION 7 STRING CONCATENATION ###

Basic Syntax

SELECT column1 + column2 AS result
FROM table;

Note:If any value is NULL, the result becomes NULL unless you handle it using ISNULL() or COALESCE().

29. Create a descriptive sentence for each employee

SELECT emp_name + ' works in ' + department + ' department.' AS employee_summary
FROM employees
WHERE department IS NOT NULL;

30. Concatenate salary with a currency label

SELECT emp_name, 'Salary: $' + CAST(salary AS VARCHAR) AS salary_info
FROM employees
WHERE salary IS NOT NULL;

31. Include hire date in a sentence (use FORMAT)

SELECT emp_name + ' joined on ' + FORMAT(hire_date, 'MMMM dd, yyyy') AS join_info
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date IS NOT NULL;

32. Handle NULL values with ISNULL()

SELECT emp_name + ' is in ' + ISNULL(department, 'No Department Assigned') AS info
FROM employees;

33. Create email ID from name and domain

Assuming your organization uses emails like firstname@company.com:

SELECT LOWER(emp_name) + '@company.com' AS email_address
FROM employees;

Note: You can use REPLACE() or SUBSTRING() to extract first names if needed.

Option 1: Using SUBSTRING + CHARINDEX

Extract first word before the space

SELECT 
    LOWER(SUBSTRING(emp_name, 1, 
        CASE 
            WHEN CHARINDEX(' ', emp_name) > 0 
            THEN CHARINDEX(' ', emp_name) - 1 
            ELSE LEN(emp_name) 
        END
    )) + '@company.com' AS email_address
FROM employees;

	Explaination:
	Finds the position of the first space using CHARINDEX.

	Uses SUBSTRING to extract from position 1 up to the first space.

	Handles single-name users like Bob too.
	
Option 2: Use REPLACE() if name has unwanted characters (e.g., dots or numbers)

SELECT 
    LOWER(REPLACE(emp_name, ' ', '')) + '@company.com' AS cleaned_email
FROM employees;

Option 3: Combine First Initial + Last Name (like jdoe@company.com)

This is useful if you want standard corporate format.

SELECT 
    LOWER(
        LEFT(emp_name, 1) + 
        SUBSTRING(emp_name, CHARINDEX(' ', emp_name) + 1, LEN(emp_name))
    ) + '@company.com' AS corp_email
FROM employees
WHERE CHARINDEX(' ', emp_name) > 0;


34. Full employee summary (name + department + salary)

SELECT emp_name + ' | ' + ISNULL(department, 'N/A') + ' | $' + CAST(ISNULL(salary, 0) AS VARCHAR) AS full_summary
FROM employees;

35. Show employee name + department location from joined tables:

SELECT e.emp_name + ' works in ' + d.dept_name + ' (' + d.location + ')' AS detailed_info
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

### SECTION 8 DISTINCT CLAUSES ###

36. List unique departments

SELECT DISTINCT department
FROM employees;

37. Get unique job titles (if you have a job_title column)

SELECT DISTINCT job_title
FROM employees;

38. Unique combinations of department and job title

SELECT DISTINCT department, job_title
FROM employees;

39. Distinct locations from joined department data

SELECT DISTINCT d.location
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

40. All unique salary values

SELECT DISTINCT salary
FROM employees;

41. Employees who changed departments (from both tables)

SELECT DISTINCT emp_id, department
FROM (
    SELECT emp_id, department FROM employees
    UNION ALL
    SELECT emp_id, department FROM retired_employees
) AS combined_depts;

Key NOTE:
~~~~~~~~
How many columns can be set in DISTINCT from a table. 

In SQL Server, there is no fixed limit on how many columns you can use with the DISTINCT clause as long as:
The key rule is:

    All selected columns must appear in the SELECT list â€” and DISTINCT will consider the entire combination of all those columns for uniqueness.
    
Example: Multi-column DISTINCT

SELECT DISTINCT emp_id, emp_name, department, salary
FROM employees;

This query returns only rows with unique combinations of all four columns.
Even if emp_id is unique, if you include other columns (like salary), rows might be considered duplicates or not depending on the full row.

SQL Server Limits (FYI)

While SQL Server does not limit DISTINCT by column count directly, practical limits exist:

Factor				Limit
~~~~~~~				~~~~~~
Max columns per SELECT		4096 columns (SQL Server 2022 and later)
Max row size			~8,060 bytes (excluding VARCHAR(MAX), TEXT, etc.)
Max index key columns		32

So yes, you can have hundreds of columns in a DISTINCT query as long as the total row size is within SQL Server's limit.
